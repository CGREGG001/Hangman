# Hangman
Hangman game in Java

"Hangman is a classic word guessing game. One player thinks of a word and represents it by a series of dashes, indicating the number of letters in the word. The other player tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. If the suggested letter is in the word, it is revealed in its correct position(s). If not, a part of a hangman diagram is drawn. The game continues until the word is guessed or the hangman diagram is complete, which indicates the guessing player has lost."
